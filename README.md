### Can we make a barplot in R using AI to generate the code

using [openai](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

we ask it `write a script in R plot a bargraph`.

we then get the following code

```
# Create sample data
x <- c("Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas", "Grapes")
y <- c(20, 15, 10, 25)

# Plot the bar graph
barplot(y, names.arg = x, main = "Fruit Sales", ylab = "Number of Sales")
```
and the follwing explaination:

**Let me explain the code line by line:

We create a vector x containing the names of fruits, and a vector y containing the number of sales for each fruit.
The barplot() function is used to create the bar graph. The first argument y is the height of the bars. The names.arg argument is used to label each bar with the corresponding fruit name. The main argument specifies the main title of the graph, and the ylab argument specifies the label for the y-axis.
When you run this code, you should see a bar graph with four bars, labeled "Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas", and "Grapes". The height of each bar corresponds to the number of sales for the corresponding fruit.**
