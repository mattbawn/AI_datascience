## How can we use open AI in assessment?

Here are some initial ideas:

- Reproduce new type of figure
- Translate code into another language
- fix broken code


`can we use chatGPT to fix broken code`

```
As an AI language model, ChatGPT can provide suggestions for fixing broken code based on its training data, but it is not designed specifically for that purpose. Its primary function is to generate human-like responses to natural language prompts.

However, there are other tools available that are specifically designed for fixing broken code, such as IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and code linters. These tools are specifically designed to analyze and identify issues in code and provide suggestions for how to fix them.

Therefore, while ChatGPT may be able to provide some suggestions for fixing broken code, it is not the most appropriate tool for that purpose. It is recommended to use specialized tools like IDEs and linters for code-related issues.
